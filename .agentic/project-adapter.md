# Project Adapter

## Project Type

- web application

## Issue Required Sections

- Context
- Requirements
- Acceptance Criteria
- Target Files

## Issue Draft Location

- optional local drafts in `.agentic/issues/drafts/`
- live GitHub Issues remain the source of truth after publication

## Execution Start Condition

Implementation may begin when the issue has `in-progress` and does not have `hold` or `needs-human`.

## Plan Visibility Mode

- issue comment

## Human Control Signals

Labels:

- `hold`
- `needs-human`

Comments:

- `stop`
- `hold`
- `change approach`
- `re-plan`

Issue comments and PR comments are both valid control surfaces.

Once a PR exists, the PR thread becomes the preferred steering surface.

## State Labels

Lifecycle:

- `ready-for-build`
- `in-progress`
- `in-review`
- `done`

Supporting labels:

- `topology:combined`
- `topology:split`
- `agent-builder`
- `frontend`
- `backend`
- `full-stack`
- `config-only`
- `docs-only`
- `hold`
- `needs-human`

## Branch Naming

- `issue-<number>-<slug>`

## Required Pre-Read Docs

- `README.md`

## Verification Commands

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:e2e`

## User-Visible Change Policy

- browser smoke coverage required for navigation, forms, cart, checkout, account, or pricing presentation changes
- preview link required if preview deployments exist

## Evidence Requirements

- screenshots
- verification summary
- trace or video for browser automation
- preview deployment link if available

## Automation Hooks

- issue readiness validation
- draft PR bootstrapper
- issue and PR state sync

## Stop-And-Ask Conditions

- authentication or session model changes
- billing or payment provider changes
- tax, shipping, fulfillment, or refund behavior changes not explicitly scoped in the issue
- PII collection, retention, or deletion behavior changes

## Repo-Specific Constraints
